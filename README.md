  ## Description

  This lesson introduces Node.js. It’s an open source server that runs JavaScript code outside a web browser. Given a starter code for this assignment, using Node.js, Inquirer, Markdown, and File System to create a README.md from a command line application to generate one. NPM (Known as Node Package Manager) is a library and registry for JavaScript software packages. I used NPM to install different packages and manage dependencies. A Table of Content organizes each selection for the viewers to access effortlessly. 

  ## Installation

  Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn’t tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running non init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies. (Forking the repo is also another option)

  ## Usage

  This organizes all the coder’s thoughts and generate a readme for them.

  ## License

  A high-quality README file is the license, this is liscensed by Apache_2.0.

  ## Contributing

  This allows coders to create an effortless readme and can be use for future assignments.

  ## Tests
